------

## Project description

After the rise of cryptocurrencies, blockchain, virtual realities came the turn of NFTs. NFT can be thought of as an irrevocable digital certificate of ownership and authenticity for a given asset. In the CCMarket you can find space-themed art NFTs created with information from NASA. Register in the app, link your personal wallet (like Revolut) and get the opportunity to own unique tokens. The application allows you to upload your personal art entities, trade these unique items, participate in auctions for the most beautiful, rare and special ones. Assemble your collection and enjoy the thrill of owning these eccentric items. Share with friends what you managed to obtain and become the greatest collector of all time. List your art work and sell it on the market, become the greates space-themed artist in the galaxy.
